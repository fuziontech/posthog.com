## A bit about us

PostHog is open-source, developer-friendly product analytics.

We had the most succesful b2b software HackerNews launch since 2012, we've got over 2K stars on our repo right now, hundreds of users and deployments at large companies.

This is a super exciting time to be joining PostHog. We're growing like crazy and we need your help.

## Our culture

In reality, as one of our first hires you'll have a large hand in shaping this, but some keywords:

* Remote first
* "Write things down"
* Prefer making things transparent and public
* No need for crazy hours. Work hard when you're working.

## Our backers

We're young, but we're already [backed](/handbook/investors) by many of the best investors in the world. This includes YCombinator, Solomon Hykes (ex-founder/CEO Docker), David Cramer (Founder/CEO Sentry), Adam Goldstein (Founder Hipmunk). See [the rest](/handbook/investors)!

# Open roles

## Designer / UX

###Â Your role

We are looking for someone that can help us rebrand and polish our website and docs. Initially, this would mean making our website and documentation much cooler. We also need ot keep things consistent with our product itself.

Adorable hedgehogs, cool dev focussed stuff. What's not to like?

We're open for ideas here - either you are more a designer than a UX person and the objective is to produce .ai or Figma files for the UX that we can then convert, or if you're happy using React and can write the components yourself, that's also cool (and a plus, but not necessary).

It is a major positive if you've worked with making technical documentation better before. We aim to get our docs to the same standard or higher than Stripe.

### Hiring process

* Please send us links to some of your previous work and a cover letter
* You'll meet our CEO James over Zoom
* We'll pay you normal contracting rates for anywhere between 1-5 days to do some work with us. That'll give you a chance to learn how we'd work with you, and for us to see how you work.
* We make a decision with you.

### How to apply

Email a thoughtful cover letter to [james@posthog.com](mailto:james@posthog.com). A good cover letter includes:

* What makes you a great designer or UX person
* A few relevant links or examples of previous design work
* What you like/dislike about PostHog

## Dev-ops / backend engineer

### Your role

We're looking for a dev-ops/backend-y engineer. Someone who's comfortable with k8s, AWS, Google Cloud, helm charts and various databases. We expect this person to contribute to our main product (backend and maybe even a bit of frontend), and help scale PostHog instances to > 10 million events/day. You'll be the third hire.

We're looking for people who are proactive and are ridiculously quick at shipping, while writing tests and generally maintining a clean codebase.

### Hiring process

* You'll have a 30 minute phone-call with our CTO Tim
* You'll meet our CEO James
* We'll pay you normal contracting rates for anywhere between 1-5 days to do some work on PostHog. This will give you a chance to learn how we'd work with you, and for us to see how you work. You'll also end up with some open-source contributions.
* We make a decision.

### How to apply

Email a thoughtful cover letter to [tim@posthog.com](mailto:tim@posthog.com). A good cover letter includes:

* What makes you a great early engineering hire
* Relevant experience/projects you've done
* What you like/dislike about PostHog
